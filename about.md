## West Chester University
During college I was an average student at best. I spent more time relaxing and playing video games than I did in the library; I was never good at studying. I managed to graduate with a 3.2 GPA but failed to have any internships. No internships was the result of me falling in love with VR during my junior year. A friend and I started embarking on a monumental contractor VR app called Walls using the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/) that ultimately died off near graduation.

## Corporate Salesforce Trainer at Revature
After graduation, I was without any glimspe of a job offer. I had begun Ubering and was getting ready to make the transition back to manual labor. Luckily for me I heard back from [Revature](revature.com). Like thousands of others, Revature's bootcamp gave me the platform I needed to enter the Software Engineering field as a Salesforce Developer. I finished at the top of my class and was offered an internal position to become a Corporate Trainer.

Within 6 months I became one of Revature's top Corporate Trainers. Being a Salesforce Trainer required working around the clock to ensure my team was successful and our clients were happy. Along with a great team, we were able to completely restructure the Salesforce curriculum to ensure a [successful](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/revature_revature-becomes-a-trailhead-academy-authorized-activity-6668154566971797505-9cKd) partnership with Salesforce - representing our team at [Dreamforce](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-ruiz-099253116_revature-activity-6600111401044369409-PdsE) both on the sales-floor and in client meetings.

After 18 months of 60-hours a week (too often 80+) and not gaining much career growth from it, I decided to leave Revature to seek a platform to grow. After interviewing for dozens of Salesforce positions and receiving a handful of offers, I realized that I was not passionate enough about Salesforce to lock myself into a long-term committment.  

## Mobile Development
Launching TeenPros revealed to me that my passion lies in the mobile-space. In January 2020 I left Revature to work full-time on shifting my career from Salesforce
Since then, I've been working on React Native for about 80+ hours a week. No joke. [BoxBets](boxbetsapp.com)
