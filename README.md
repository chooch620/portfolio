Hola!

My name is Matt and I'm from Philly, PA. I earned my Bachelor’s Degree of Computer Science in 2018 from West Chester University of Pennsylvania. Prior to college I spent weekends and summers as an apprentice in a relative’s Contracting company. I've always enjoyed working.

I no longer specialize in electrical outlets and now spend my time building mobile apps with React Native, Swift, Firebase, and more. I hope to use my experience as a Salesforce Developer/Trainer to push the boundaries of mobile development.  

To learn how I got to this point, please checkout my [about](https://github.com/chooch620/portfolio/blob/master/about.md) section.

## TeenPros (#teenpros)
While working at Revature I spent what little free time I had working on [TeenPros](teenprofessionals.com), which has reduced the cost of local professionals by up to 80%. This mobile platform consists of two iOS applications that work together to provide a handyman app. These apps connect homeowners who need help and young people who want to work.
