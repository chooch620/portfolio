Hola!

My name is Matt and I'm from Philly, PA. I earned my Bachelor’s Degree of Computer Science in 2018 from West Chester University of Pennsylvania. Prior to college I spent most of my time from 10 - 18 as an apprentice in a relative’s Contracting company. Weekends and summers were spent working to help support the family. 

During college I was an average student at best. I ended up with a 3.2

Post graduation, I quickly became one of the top-performing Corporate Trainers at Revature LLC within 6 months. Being a Salesforce Trainer required working around the clock to ensure my team was successful and our clients were happy. Along with a great team, we were able to restructure the Salesforce curriculum to ensure a [successful](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/revature_revature-becomes-a-trailhead-academy-authorized-activity-6668154566971797505-9cKd) partnership with Salesforce.

While being a Trainer, I assisted a friend in launching [TeenPros](teenprofessionals.com), a handyman app that has reduced the cost of local professionals by up to 80%. 

After leaving Revature in January 2020 I've been working on [BoxBets](boxbetsapp.com) and AYF-Panama.
