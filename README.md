Hola!

My name is Matt and I'm from Philly, PA. I earned his Bachelor’s Degree in 2018 from West Chester University of Pennsylvania. Prior to college I spent most of my time from 10 - 18 as an apprentice in a relative’s Contracting company. Weekends and summers were spent working to help support the family. 

Post graduation, I quickly became one of the top-performing Corporate Trainers at Revature LLC within 6 months. Being a trainer required working around the clock to ensure my team was successful and our clients were happy. While being a Trainer, I assisted a friend in launching [TeenPros](teenprofessionals.com), a handyman app that has reduced the cost of local professionals by up to 80%. 

After leaving Revature in January 2020 I've been working on [BoxBets](boxbetsapp.com) and AYF-Panama.
